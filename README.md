## Overview

**COMPASS** aims to democratize high-resolution light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. By combining **modular optomechanics**, **cutting-edge lens simulations**, and **intelligent software**, **COMPASS** enables the rapid assembly of light-sheet fluorescence microscopes that deliver ~235 nm lateral and ~465 nm axial resolution in a user-friendly package.

## Motivation

Cellular behavior is orchestrated by diverse signaling mechanisms that often hinge on **molecular events precisely organized in space and time**. These events include rapid, localized protein interactions that drive processes such as cell division, migration, and differentiation. **COMPASS** addresses the need for **high-resolution live-cell imaging**, empowering researchers to:

- Visualize spatially regulated processes.
- Collect quantitative 3D time-lapse data.
- Bridge molecular probe design and advanced computational image analysis.

## Goal

The overarching goal is to provide a **modular, cost-effective 3D light-sheet microscope** that:
- Can be assembled with minimal prior optics expertise.
- Consistently achieves ~235 nm lateral and ~465 nm axial resolution.
- Seamlessly integrates with our user-friendly, **intelligent imaging software** [navigate](https://github.com/TheDeanLab/navigate).
- Streamlines data acquisition, drastically reducing barriers to cutting-edge microscopy.

## Key Features

1. **High-Resolution Optics**  
   - Optical designs extensively **simulated in Ansys Zemax OpticStudio** to ensure robust performance across the visible spectrum.
   - Thorough **tolerance analysis** to maintain alignment and resolution in non-specialist environments.

2. **Rugged Mechanical Design**  
   - **Computer aided design (CAD) with Autodesk Inventor** for stress testing and mechanical reliability.
   - **Xometry** manufacturing ensures precision component fabrication.
   - **Dowel pins** and **Thorlabs Polaris mounts** allow reproducible alignment of optical elements.

3. **Easy-to-Source Components**  
   - Optics primarily sourced from **Thorlabs**, with **Polaris mounts** for stable positioning.
   - Motion control solutions (X, Y, Z, Focus, Sample Scanning) from **Applied Scientific Instrumentation**.
   - Open-hardware ethos with minimal custom parts to reduce cost and wait times.
   - Detailed step-by-step assembly instructions,

4. **Intuitive Control Software**  
   - Built to interface seamlessly with [navigate](https://github.com/TheDeanLab/navigate).
   - Automated routines for calibration, 3D volume acquisition, and intelligent imaging.
