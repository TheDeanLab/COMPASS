Simulations
-------------------
While there is a variety of software available for simulating optical systems, Ansys
Zemax Opticstudio is our software of choice.

For the design of custom parts and the baseplate, we used Autodesk Inventor. Academic licenses for Autodesk products
are available free of charge on their `website <https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&filters=individual>`_ .

Other 3D modeling software like Autodesk AutoCAD, Autodesk Fusion 360, and Solidworks are all reasonable alternatives for aspects of 3D design.
