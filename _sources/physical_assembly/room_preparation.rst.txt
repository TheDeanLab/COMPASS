Preparation of the Imaging Room
###############################

A common question that we get is how to set up the room for imaging. This section will
go over the steps that we took to set up the room for imaging. The stated directions
assume that the system will be housed in the United States. If you are in a different
country, you may need to adjust the electrical configuration accordingly.

Power Outlets
-------------------
The first thing to consider is the power outlets. For most imaging systems, you will
need standard 120V outlets. If you plan on having a Ti-Sapphire laser, then 240V
outlets are likely necessary. We typically like to have power strips on the
walls, so that you have plenty to choose from.

Temperature Control
-------------------
Temperature control is important for imaging. We recommend having a temperature sensor
in the room for controlling the temperature in that zone. Otherwise, the electronics
and people can heat up the room significantly, which can cause drift in the imaging
system. HVAC systems can also be a source of dust. Ideally, the ventilation to the room
will be HEPA filtered and the air flow will be directed away from the microscope.

Painting the Walls
-------------------
We typically paint the walls matte black. The matte black walls are helpful for reducing
the glare from the monitor and other sources of scattered light from being detected with
the camera.

Network Connections
-------------------
We recommend having a 10G network or faster for transferring data. This will help with
the transfer of large image files that are generated during imaging.

Curtains
-------------------
If you expect other people to work in the space at the same time, or if you want multiple
microscopes, we recommend having blackout curtains to separate the spaces. If the
imaging space does not have a fire sprinkler, then the curtain will likely need a gap
between the ceiling and the curtain to meet building regulations.

House Air
-------------------
You will need house air operating at ~100 PSI to float the table. Having gas cylinders
is not an option, as the tank will likely have to be replaced too frequently.

Floor Flatness
-------------------
The floor should be flat. If the floor is not flat, then the table will need special
accessories to make it level.

External Sources of Vibration
-------------------
Make sure that the room is not near any external sources of vibration. This can include
elevators, HVAC units, or other heavy machinery. Especially when imaging in soft
substrates such as expanded tissues, or reconstituted extracellular matrix environments,
 vibrations can degrade imaging quality. In general, microscopy rooms in basements are
 preferable, as they are less likely to be affected by external sources of vibration.

Water Damage
-------------------
Also consider worst-case scenarios such as a water leak from the room above. If there is
 a significant risk that the fire sprinkler system could go off, then you may want to
 consider mechanisms of protecting the electronics and optics from water damage.
