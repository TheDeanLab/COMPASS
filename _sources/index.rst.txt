**COMPASS**
#####################

Biologists are increasingly transitioning towards more complex assays that require volumetric imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution. Whether it is a developing embryo, the formation of an immunological synapse, cancer migrating through a 3D collagen matrix, these biological processes can only be understood when non-invasively and quantitatively evaluated in their entirety through time.

To meet these growing demands, we aim to develop simplified optical systems that provide cutting-edge imaging performance while ensuring ease of assembly and accessibility. By leveraging precision-engineered, baseplate-mounted designs, we eliminate unnecessary degrees of freedom, making high-resolution light-sheet microscopy more robust, reproducible, and approachable for researchers across disciplines. Our goal is to create powerful yet modular imaging platforms that enable biologists to focus on discovery rather than instrument complexity, accelerating the adoption of advanced volumetric imaging techniques.
