Rescaling
______________________________

With a properly deskewed image set, the next step is to work to rescale the image set dimensions to properly
represent the physical pixel sizes in every dimension. The first step to doing this involves going to the
properties tab of the image stack (Image-> Properties) and adjusting each dimension such that the x and y values
correspond to the xy pixel size based on the system magnification and camera sensor size, and the z value
corresponding to the z step size as an effective z pixel size. While using our angled piezo configuration, the z step
size :math:`\delta_z` doesn't directly correspond to the step size chosen for the piezo via navigate. Depicted
graphically below, the actual z step size is related to both the angle for the piezo and the piezo step size
:math:`\delta _p` .

An example of what these values can be is shown below, where for our camera and system magnification our xy pixel
size is the same at 130 nm, while we used a piezo step size of 200 nm in Navigate. Using the relationship shown above
to find :math:`\delta _z`, we find our actual z-step size is roughly 98.5 nm. Then we can adjust the image stack
properties panel as follows:

With the properties panel adjusted, the next step is to open the rescaling panel in ImageJ (Image-> Scale). In this
panel, the relative ratios of each of the pixel sizes to each other needs to be established. As an example for our
system, our x and y pixel sizes are the same at 130 nm and our z-step size :math:`\delta _z` is 98.5 nm. The ratio
between these values is roughly 0.757, so our rescaling panel looks like the following:

After selecting OK, ImageJ will then rescale the dimensions of the image stack relative to the values entered in the
rescaling panel. In our case, there would be no adjustments to x or y, but z would be rescaled from it's original
value.
