Biologists are increasingly transitioning
towards more complex assays that require volumetric imaging with high spatiotemporal
resolution. Whether it is a developing embryo, the formation of a cell-cell
immunological synapse, breast cancer organoids migrating through a 3D collagen
matrix, or cytoskeletal rearrangements in a polarized epithelial monolayer, these
biological processes can only be understood when non-invasively and quantitatively
evaluated in their entirety through time.


**Project Philosophy**
=========================

* Simple to assemble, high-performance, light-sheet microscopes.
* Highly optimized operation with **navigate** software.
* Simplified optomechanical design for ease of use and maintenance.
* Streamlined optoelectronics and control for robust and reliable operation.


.. note::

   This project is under active development.
