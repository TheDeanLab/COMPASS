Biologists are increasingly transitioning
towards more complex assays that require volumetric imaging with high spatiotemporal
resolution. Whether it is a developing embryo, the formation of a cell-cell
immunological synapse, breast cancer organoids migrating through a 3D collagen
matrix, or cytoskeletal rearrangements in a polarized epithelial monolayer, these
biological processes can only be understood when non-invasively and quantitatively
evaluated in their entirety through time.


**Project Philosophy**
=========================

* Amazing microscopes.
* Streamlined operation with navigate software.


.. note::

   This project is under active development.

    Please be advised that while the Dean Lab has implemented several safeguards,
    there are inherent risks associated with the use of such
    mechanical and optical systems. Despite these precautions, the complexity and nature of
    hardware can lead to unpredictable outcomes. Therefore, the Dean Lab and UT
    Southwestern expressly disclaim any responsibility for any damages, losses, or
    injuries that may arise from or be related to the use of **navigate-hardware**.
    Users should be aware of these risks and agree to utilize **navigate-hardware** at their own risk.
