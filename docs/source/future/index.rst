The development of **Altair** is an ongoing effort, with future iterations aimed at increasing both **complexity and capability** to support volumetric imaging across a diverse range of specimens and experimental contexts. Each implementation will be **versioned** and accompanied by comprehensive documentation, ensuring that researchers can **replicate and modify** the system at a fraction of the cost of commercial alternatives. To foster **open development and community-driven innovation**, we encourage users to **request features and provide feedback** publicly via
`Altair GitHub Issues <https://github.com/TheDeanLab/altair/issues>`_.

The projected design roadmap includes:

- **Sample-scanning light-sheet microscope** for imaging cells on glass coverslips.
- **Sample-scanning Axially Swept Light-Sheet Microscope (ASLM).**
- **Laser-scanning Axially Swept Light-Sheet Microscope.**
- **Sample-scanning Oblique Plane Microscope (OPM).**
- **Laser-scanning Oblique Plane Microscope.**

Beyond these core designs, we aim to develop **modular additions** that extend Altairâ€™s functionality, including **optogenetic stimulation** for targeted cellular activation and **multiplexed imaging** for simultaneous readouts of multiple probes. Through this iterative approach, Altair will continue evolving as a **highly adaptable, cost-effective, and open-source platform** for cutting-edge volumetric imaging.
