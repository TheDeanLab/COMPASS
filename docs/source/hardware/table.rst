Optical Table
###############################

The optical table is the most important part of the imaging room. We recommend a large
table, as it is better to have too much table than not enough. Ideally, the room is
large enough that the table is not completely against the wall, so that you have access
to the entire table.

---------------

Table Height
-------------------
Having a table at the right height makes working at the table more comfortable. We
recommend that the table surface be located approximately 38 - 40 inches from the
floor.

---------------

Table Thickness
-------------------
We typically purchase tables with an 18" thickness. In theory, thicker tables better
dampen vibrations arising from on the table itself, including fans from cameras,
voice coils, stages, etc. Practically, in our experience, the table thickness helps
mitigate vibrations arising from the building itself as well. 

---------------

Table Accessories
-------------------
We recommend getting a table with a shelf and power strips. The shelf is useful for
storing electronics and other equipment in a location where their vibrations will not
be coupled to the table.

---------------

Hole Pattern
-------------------
All of our optical mounts are designed to fit the 1” grid pattern with 1/4”-20 holes.
If you would like to have metric holes, you will need to customize the mounts to fit the
table.

---------------

Casters
-------------------
Casters serve as a very convenient mechanism for moving the table around. We thus
highly recommend getting a table with casters. Otherwise, most tables are
sufficiently heavy that they will not be able to be moved once installed.

---------------

Vibration Damping
-------------------
Many vibration damping systems actually amplify vibrations at low frequencies, which
are common building-associated vibrations. To mitigate this, we recommend using a
tuned damping system. TMC provides and UltraDamp series of isolation systems that

---------------

Table Installation
-------------------
We recommend following the manufacturer’s instructions for installing the table.
Importantly the frame, and the table top should be level in order to achieve the best
performance. Given the weight of the table, it is likely that professional
installation will be required.

---------------

Recommended Table
-------------------
We typically purchase Performance Series CleanTop Research Grade 784 Series Optical
Tables from TMC. These tables are available in a variety of sizes, and the weight can
be estimated from the lateral dimensions of the table and its thickness. To increase
the weight and damping capacity of the table, we opt for the 18" standard thickness.
This is placed on a set of 14-Special UltraDamp legs that are equipped with casters
and provide a 20" working height, and a total overall table height of 38".
