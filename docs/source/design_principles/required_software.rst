Simulations
-------------------
While there are a variety of softwares available for simulating optical systems, Ansys Zemax Opticstudio is our software of choice.

For the design of custom parts and the baseplate, we used Autodesk Inventor. Academic licenses for Autodesk products
are available free of charge on their `website <https://www.autodesk.com/education/edu-software/overview?sorting=featured&filters=individual>`_ .

Other 3D modeling softwares like Autodesk AutoCAD, Autodesk Fusion 360, and Solidworks are all reasonable alternatives for aspects of 3D design.
